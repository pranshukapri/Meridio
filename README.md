Merídio(<i>Greek</i>-Share) is a free Filehosting platform where users can host their own repositories of files/videos/images etc and thus make it available for download by any of the registered members of the website.The key aim is to create a network of users who can host items in their repositories and allow other people to access the repository contents and also download stuff from others repositories.Merídio also has an inbuilt chat feature where you can add friends via requests and chat with your friends.
### Signup and Login Page
Meridio prompts you for some user details for sign up. These are the starting steps in the creation of a user profile.

#### Repository internal structure
Each repository has a list of all the files uploaded by the owner of that repository along with information such as the total number of downloads and views tagged along with each file. Each file list element has a preview and a download button. The preview button directs the user to a new page where the preview of the file(music,images,pdfs,vidoes etc) is generated. The download button downloads that file.
